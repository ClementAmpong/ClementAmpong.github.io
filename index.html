            <h3>Forecasting Influenza Dynamics in the US</h3>
            <p>Developed predictive models to forecast influenza epidemics in the United States using the n-sub epidemic model and the STAT MOD PREDICT toolbox. This project evaluated the performance of various forecasting approaches to provide accurate and timely predictions of influenza dynamics. The goal was to support public health planning and intervention strategies by identifying patterns and trends in disease spread. This work underscores the importance of mathematical modeling in epidemic forecasting and highlights its potential to mitigate the impact of seasonal influenza outbreaks.</p>

            <h3>Parameter Estimation and Forecasting Using ODE Models</h3>
            <p>Performed parameter estimation and forecasting for the 1918 influenza pandemic using the SEIR model and QuantDiffForecast MATLAB toolbox. Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) were employed to estimate the transmission rate and generate forecasts with quantified uncertainty. The study evaluated the performance of both methods, demonstrating that MLE provided tighter uncertainty bounds and superior reliability. This work underscores the importance of advanced mathematical modeling techniques in epidemic forecasting and their potential to enhance public health planning.</p>

            <h3>Extension of the SEIR Model</h3>
            <p>Designed and analyzed extended SEIR models to incorporate more realistic stages of disease progression. The first model added a mildly symptomatic class, demonstrating that increasing the infectiousness of this group accelerates disease spread and raises the basic reproduction number (R<sub>0</sub>). The second model introduced a hospitalized class, showing that reducing the infectiousness of hospitalized individuals through infection control measures significantly decreases R<sub>0</sub> and slows the epidemic. Simulations highlighted the critical role of these compartments in disease dynamics and underscored the importance of targeting them with public health interventions to control transmission effectively.</p>

            <h3>Selection in a Population of Three Phenotypes</h3>
            <p>Analyzed the effects of selection in a population with three distinct phenotypes (white, gray, and black-winged moths) using a recurrence relation derived from a Punnett square. The study examined the dynamics of allele frequencies under varying selection pressures and identified conditions for phenotype coexistence or extinction. Cobweb diagrams were utilized to visualize long-term allele frequency behaviors, revealing that gray-winged moths survive only under specific selective advantages. This work highlights the application of mathematical modeling in understanding population genetics and the impact of selection on genetic diversity.</p>

            <h3>Data-Enabled Modeling of an Epidemic: Smallpox and COVID-19</h3>
            <p>Analyzed the dynamics of the smallpox epidemic in Abakaliki, Nigeria (1967), and the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (2020) using the SIR model. Key parameters, such as transmission and recovery rates, were estimated to understand disease spread and predict intervention strategies. For smallpox, vaccinating a minimum of 15 individuals would have reduced the susceptible population below the epidemic threshold, effectively halting the outbreak. For COVID-19, the analysis determined that vaccinating or quarantining over 11 million individuals could have stopped the pandemic. This project underscores the importance of vaccination and highlights the limitations of deterministic models in capturing human behavior and uncertainty.</p>

            <h3>Predicting Malignancy in Breast Cancer Using Gaussian Process Regression</h3>
            <p>Conducted an in-depth analysis of clinical features to predict breast cancer malignancy using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The project captured nonlinear relationships between features and improved diagnostic accuracy. Key predictors, including mean radius, mean area, and mean perimeter, were identified, enhancing the interpretability of the model through robust prediction intervals. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of GPR in medical prediction tasks, highlighting its potential for applications in cancer diagnosis and broader healthcare analytics.</p>
