            <h3>Forecasting Growth Trajectories Using Phenomenological Growth Models</h3>
            <p>Applied the QuantDiffForecast toolbox to model and forecast time-series data of daily monkeypox cases in the USA using phenomenological growth models. This project aimed to accurately predict growth trajectories, understand the dynamics of disease spread, and assess the practical implications of the models in guiding public health decisions. The work demonstrates the effectiveness of advanced mathematical tools in addressing emerging health challenges and provides a framework for applying similar methodologies to other infectious diseases.</p>

            <h3>Parameter Estimation and Forecasting Using ODE Models</h3>
            <p>Performed parameter estimation and forecasting for the 1918 influenza pandemic using the SEIR model and QuantDiffForecast MATLAB toolbox. Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) were employed to estimate the transmission rate and generate forecasts with quantified uncertainty. The study evaluated the performance of both methods, demonstrating that MLE provided tighter uncertainty bounds and superior reliability. This work underscores the importance of advanced mathematical modeling techniques in epidemic forecasting and their potential to enhance public health planning.</p>

            <h3>Extension of the SEIR Model</h3>
            <p>Designed and analyzed extended SEIR models to incorporate more realistic stages of disease progression. The first model added a mildly symptomatic class, demonstrating that increasing the infectiousness of this group accelerates disease spread and raises the basic reproduction number (R<sub>0</sub>). The second model introduced a hospitalized class, showing that reducing the infectiousness of hospitalized individuals through infection control measures significantly decreases R<sub>0</sub> and slows the epidemic. Simulations highlighted the critical role of these compartments in disease dynamics and underscored the importance of targeting them with public health interventions to control transmission effectively.</p>

            <h3>Selection in a Population of Three Phenotypes</h3>
            <p>Analyzed the effects of selection in a population with three distinct phenotypes (white, gray, and black-winged moths) using a recurrence relation derived from a Punnett square. The study examined the dynamics of allele frequencies under varying selection pressures and identified conditions for phenotype coexistence or extinction. Cobweb diagrams were utilized to visualize long-term allele frequency behaviors, revealing that gray-winged moths survive only under specific selective advantages. This work highlights the application of mathematical modeling in understanding population genetics and the impact of selection on genetic diversity.</p>

            <h3>Data-Enabled Modeling of an Epidemic: Smallpox and COVID-19</h3>
            <p>Analyzed the dynamics of the smallpox epidemic in Abakaliki, Nigeria (1967), and the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (2020) using the SIR model. Key parameters, such as transmission and recovery rates, were estimated to understand disease spread and predict intervention strategies. For smallpox, vaccinating a minimum of 15 individuals would have reduced the susceptible population below the epidemic threshold, effectively halting the outbreak. For COVID-19, the analysis determined that vaccinating or quarantining over 11 million individuals could have stopped the pandemic. This project underscores the importance of vaccination and highlights the limitations of deterministic models in capturing human behavior and uncertainty.</p>

            <h3>Forecasting Influenza Dynamics in the US</h3>
            <p>This study explored advanced forecasting techniques for influenza outbreaks across the United States using the n-sub epidemic model and the STAT MOD PREDICT toolbox. Weekly influenza case data from May to October 2024, collected through CDC surveillance and wastewater monitoring, were modeled to assess outbreak dynamics. Predictive models, including ARIMA, GLM, GAM, Prophet, and ensemble approaches, were employed to generate region-specific forecasts.</p>

            <p>The analysis identified ARIMA as the most effective model for forecasting influenza dynamics across all regions, achieving the lowest error metrics (MAE and MSE) and reliable 95% prediction intervals. Weighted ensemble models also demonstrated strong performance in areas with complex epidemic patterns. By leveraging advanced statistical methods, the study provided accurate short-term forecasts to support early intervention and resource allocation strategies.</p>

            <p>This work underscores the critical role of robust predictive modeling and surveillance data integration in guiding public health responses. The findings emphasize the potential of these methodologies to mitigate the societal impact of influenza outbreaks by enabling timely and informed decision-making.</p>

            <h3>Application of Linear Programming in Profit Maximization of Asanduff Construction</h3>
            <p>Applied linear programming techniques to optimize profit for Asanduff Construction, a block manufacturing company producing four types of blocks (8-inch, 6-inch, 5-inch, and 4-inch). By incorporating data on production costs, labor, time, and sales into a linear programming model, the study employed Excel Solver and the simplex method to identify the optimal production strategy.</p>

            <p>The analysis revealed that prioritizing the production of 8-inch, 6-inch, and 5-inch blocks while reducing resources allocated to 4-inch blocks maximized daily profits to GHC 5564. This optimization resulted in a <strong>27.1% increase in daily profits</strong>, showcasing the effectiveness of linear programming in driving significant financial improvements. Additionally, shadow price analysis provided insights into constraints impacting profitability, guiding better resource allocation.</p>

            <p>This work highlights the value of mathematical optimization in enhancing profitability, improving operational efficiency, and supporting strategic decision-making in manufacturing processes.</p>
